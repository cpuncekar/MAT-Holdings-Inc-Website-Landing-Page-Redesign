# MAT Holdings Website Modernization (Concept Demo)

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a **proof-of-concept redesign** of the MAT Holdings, Inc. website.  
The goal was to demonstrate how AI-assisted tools like **Bolt.new** can speed up web design while still allowing for intentional design decisions and refinement.  

This is **not a full rebuild** — just a concept demo to show modernization possibilities.
This version is a reduced showcase — some assets, images, and copy were intentionally left out.

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools Used
- **Figma** → add notes to the the original landing page, create a low fidelity mockup for the new layout
- **Bolt.new** → for AI-assisted code generation and rapid prototyping
- **ChatGPT** → helping with prompt creation
- **Midjourney** Create images in midjourney where appropriate
- **Photoshop** Light photoshop for resizing of images
- **GitHub** → for version control and documentation

## 🎨 Design Decisions & Thought Process
I started by reviewing MAT Holdings’ existing homepage. A few things stood out:  
- The hero section felt heavy and outdated, with too much dark imagery.
- Key stats (employees, factories, revenue) deserved more visual emphasis.  
- Content blocks needed more whitespace and a cleaner grid layout.
- Add in an FAQ section to help visitors/clients/customers answer quick questions they may have.
- Automotive and Consumer buttons should be highlighted on the landing page with their own tabs. A link to learn more that goes to another info page(s) would be ideal later on.
- Created images in Midjourney to have image placeholders but also give an updated look and experiment with what is possible for MAT.

**My approach:**  
1. Sketched out a quick wireframe of an updated homepage flow:  
   - Hero with bold headline + CTA  
   - Stats section with animated counters  
   - Grid-based visuals for multiple industries  
   - Clear CTA at the bottom (“Build Your Future with MAT Holdings”)  
2. Translated that wireframe into structured prompts for Bolt.new.  
3. Ran multiple generations, refined until the layout matched the design intent.  
4. Packaged the results here as a concept demo.

## 📊 Competitor Research
As part of this exercise, I looked at a few similar companies in the diversified manufacturing/consumer products space:  
- **Marmon Holdings** → runs on WordPress  
- **A.O. Smith** → runs on Salesforce Experience Cloud  
- **Central Garden & Pet** → runs on Sitecore  

These comparisons reinforced the idea that **WordPress** (with a modern builder/theme) would be a strong long-term platform for MAT, balancing scalability with ease of use.

## 📝 Next Steps (If This Were a Full Project)
- Expand beyond homepage/landing page → About, Industries, Careers, Contact, All other pages needed
- Layer in SEO optimization, analytics, and performance tuning  
- Create a unified design system for consistent branding across all pages
- Would of course add in actual logos, real copy, and images 

## Issues with AI/ what it is Good For
- AI is great to get ideas out there and experiment
- AI is great for landing pages and or a splash advertisment page
- AI does take some time to tweak and make updates
- AI is not a magic bullet

## ⚡ Final Notes
This project is meant as a **quick modernization demo** — not a finished product.  
It shows how AI + designer intent can combine to move quickly without sacrificing quality.
